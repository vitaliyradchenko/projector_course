In fact it is easier to work with MSE. But there is a little bit of difference between the two for gradient-based models. The gradient of RMSE with respect to i-th prediction is basically equal to gradient of MSE multiplied by some value. The value doesn't depend on the index I. It means that travelling along MSE gradient is equivalent to traveling along RMSE gradient but with a different flowing rate and the flowing rate depends on MSE score itself. So, it is kind of dynamic.So even though RMSE and MSE are really similar in terms of models scoring, they can be not immediately interchangeable for gradient based methods. We will probably need to adjust some parameters like the learning rate.\n",

Create a variable that will have a value 'train' for examples in the train set or 'test' otherwise. Build a classifier that will try to predict whether an example belongs to either of two groups. * After that select the top examples with the highest probability to be included in the test and make them your validation.\n",
